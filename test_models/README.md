# Benchmarking and Analysis of Pre-trained Functionals

This directory contains the scripts and data required to use the pre-trained neural network functionals and reproduce the benchmark results presented in our paper.

The primary analyses include:
1.  **Thermochemical Accuracy:** Evaluating the WTMAD-2 metric on the Diet-GMTKN55 benchmark set.
2.  **Enhancement Factor Analysis:** Plotting the behavior of the enhancement factor `F_xc` to gain physical insight.
3.  **Electron Density Accuracy:** Calculating molecular (avRANE) and atomic (MaxNE) density errors against high-level reference data.

## Prerequisites

- **Environment:** Ensure you have created a virtual environment and installed the necessary packages.
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Pre-trained Models:** The required `.pth` model files are already included in the `DFT/checkpoints/` subdirectory.
- **Computational Chemistry Software:** Some analysis steps, particularly for density accuracy, require external tools like **Multiwfn**.

## Benchmark 1: Thermochemical Accuracy (Diet-GMTKN55)

This procedure calculates the reaction energies for the 30-reaction subset of GMTKN55 and computes the WTMAD-2 error metric. The workflow relies on the `InterfaceG16.py` script and is designed for a SLURM-based HPC cluster.

#### Step 1: Prepare System Input Files
First, generate the geometry input files (`.gif_`) for all molecular systems in the benchmark set.

```bash
python InterfaceG16.py --Mode GE
```
This will populate the `GIF/` directory with subdirectories for each system, containing the geometry file and pre-generated SLURM submission scripts.

#### Step 2: Run Energy Calculations
Submit the energy calculation jobs to the SLURM queue. You must do this for each functional you wish to evaluate. The script will automatically find and submit the corresponding job files.

```bash
# Example for our primary model
python InterfaceG16.py --Mode CE --Functional NN_PBE_067

# Example for the parent PBE functional
python InterfaceG16.py --Mode CE --Functional PBE

# Repeat for other functionals like NN_PBE_star, NN_XALPHA_067, SCAN, etc.
```

#### Step 3: Collate and Analyze Results
After all jobs are complete, a `.txt` file for each functional will be created in the `Results/` directory, containing the calculated energy for each system.

To compute the WTMAD-2 metric and generate a comparative summary table, run the following commands:
```bash
# 1. Run the analysis mode for each functional to print WTMAD-2 to console
python InterfaceG16.py --Functional NN_PBE_067 > Results/NN_PBE.txt
python InterfaceG16.py --Functional PBE > Results/PBE-D3BJ.txt
# ... repeat for all other functionals ...

# 2. Convert the text outputs into a single summary CSV file
cd Results/
python txt_to_csv.py
```
This will create `DietGMTKN55_results.csv` in the `Results/` folder.

## Benchmark 2: Enhancement Factor Analysis

These scripts reproduce the enhancement factor analysis from Figure 4 of the paper.

#### 1. Plot F_xc vs. Normed Gradient (s)
This script calculates the dependency of the enhancement factor on the reduced density gradient `s` for different values of the iso-orbital indicator `Î±`.

```bash
python plot_exc.py
```
This will generate `Results/exc.npy`, containing the data used for the plots.

## Benchmark 3: Electron Density Accuracy

This is a multi-step process that requires **PySCF**, **Multiwfn**, and reference density files.

### Part A: Molecular Density Accuracy (avRANE)

#### Setup
1.  **Edit Paths:** Open `get_molden.py` and modify the hardcoded paths to your **Multiwfn** executable and the `den_mol_or`/`denrho` directories.
2.  **Reference Densities:** You will need reference CCSD densities. Place them in a file named `den_mol_or/REF/CCSORT.npz`. You will also need LDA densities, which should be placed in the `den_mol_or/calc/LDA_pyscf/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).

#### Step 1: Run SCF Calculations
This script submits SLURM jobs to run self-consistent field (SCF) calculations for a set of small molecules and atoms, generating `.wfn` files and density grid data.

```bash
# Example for NN-PBE
python run_molden.py --Functional NN_PBE_067
```

#### Step 2: Process Densities and Calculate avRANE
Once the jobs are complete, navigate to the `den_mol_or` directory and run the processing scripts.

```bash
cd ../den_mol_or/

# 1. Convert Multiwfn outputs into compressed .npz files
python calcden.py

# 2. Calculate the Normalized Integral Absolute Difference and avRANE
python dniad
```
The final avRANE values will be printed to the console.

### Part B: Atomic Density Accuracy (MaxNE)

This benchmark uses the atomic `.wfn` files generated in the previous step.

#### Step 1: Generate Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs)
For each functional, navigate to its output directory within `../denrho/dtestin/` and execute the `swfn` script. This script uses Multiwfn to generate `.rdf` files.

```bash
# Example for NN-PBE
cd ../denrho/dtestin/NN_PBE_067/
./swfn
```
*Note: Ensure the path to Multiwfn in the `swfn` script is correct for your system.*

#### Step 2: Calculate MaxNE
Navigate to the `denrho` directory and run the `krms` script to compare the generated RDFs against the CCSD reference and compute the MaxNE metric.

```bash
cd ../../denrho/

# Example for NN-PBE
./krms NN_PBE_067 CCSD
```
The script will print the MaxNE values for RHO, GRD, and LR descriptors to the console.
